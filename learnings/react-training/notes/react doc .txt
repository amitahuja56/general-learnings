----facebook cli setup

npm install create-react-app -g

based on webpack setup

----ES6

Topics required for reacta are:

1. let const
2. arrow functions
3. classes

In redux

4. spread
5. object destructuring

Q. When does the hoisting happen?


parse start -->model forms leaxical tree--> (but memoery is added at the time of execution)
during compilation time


so if condtion is false....var gets undefined....
then IIFE we can use.... to maintain
scope

so use let--> which at the backend the of the writes an IIFE for you.


Q.datatypes:
number 64bit---double rep by default
boolean-
string-
undefined- no valid literal
NaN- Another predefined lteral.....numberial error....
inifinity- another literal divided 
null-
object-
function- not there in another language....soul of JS ...funtional programing/....

***not recommended class patetrn



3 tyoes of strinf ==
""
''
`` 
for est6 :
console.log(`Name ${name}`);  is similar to consol.log('Name: ' +name);

------------------------------------------------------------------------

function flavours:


curry functions then callbacks also HOF
higer order funtions
/////
function sayHai(){
};
let hai = sayHai;

like C pointer...this holds the pointer ref to definitation.
///////

let greet = function sayGreet(){

}
greet();

cant use sayGreet() thngs at all only greet
///////////////////////////////////////////////

default parameters are there in the ES6

works for undefined or null or NaN-are falsy....works for empty string and 0........

add(num = 'default' ){
}

0 fasle null undefined '' NaN-genreal false values



concureency-async-same

concureency-----------------
1- threads -thread manager....all c, c++ 
2- event lop---why not thread>?> issues.....so eventloop architecture came.....

JS enigne is single thread.....but has benifits ovr threads.....
most popualrize by node

threfore, progaming using callbacks....for concureency


any program has two states....passsive(HD) ....active(RAM)



heap-dyn stack-dyn program data-pass

100 lines
1 line allocated memoery
99 in PD


stcak frame--active functoin

stack---only one funtuon at once--SF

making two SF together----concureency


then ... it is done by time sharing


///////////bind the functoin----to event----so that funtion goes to queue.....and then SF when even is fired,,,


tyes of event:
mouse click and all :P


==========
network event-ajax
gui event- mouse
timer event - setTime

Whenever event is emitted the queed entr the stack

read about bind and call


heaps....
evrey process has neeed of heap...memory allocation....dynamic memory allocation.
allocated on fly...

stack mm=ekory is used by the only funition


object is basciaaly memoery that can reused;

funtuon-stack
funtion passed as param and event is binded- queue
function decl with new - pushed to heap.



inheritance-----exteds
super is a ref to a parent class......this is ref to present clss....super.somthi()

static variables is not on heap......its on PD...
anyways... 


why require js?
diff bw common and amd!


link two files and then donot write export...then its priavte!

eport default --> without curly can import --> allowed only one time
export --> with curly braces --> allowed n times
