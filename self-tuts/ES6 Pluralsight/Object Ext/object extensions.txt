////////////
symbols

let a = symbol('uch bhi');

this gives a unique key to it


and there are 

well known symbols for it as well.


/////////////

object extensions

let a ={a:'sadsad'}, b={b:'ddsdasdsa'}, target={};
Object.assign(target, a, b);

then one more...


Object.is(); ////// ===


does the same work more logically
